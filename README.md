# JS-SDK
This mono-repository contains components of an old Genestack JavaScript 
software development kit. These components are deprecated and support for
these components will be removed in the future versions of Genestack
platform.

3rd party developers that might use this SDK should switch to using ODM
REST APIs instead.

## Components
* [`@genestack/system-api` To use in browser](./packages/system-api/README.md)
* [`@genestack/ui-proxy` to see changes in your UI on top of Genestack application without
  redeploy](./packages/ui-proxy/README.md)
